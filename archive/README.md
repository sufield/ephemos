# Archive Directory

This directory contains code and examples that have been archived from the main project for the 0.1 release.

## Contents

### examples/
The examples directory has been moved here to prepare for the 0.1 release. These examples will be maintained as a separate project when version 0.1 is released.

**Note**: These examples are no longer part of the CI/CD pipeline and are not built as part of the main project.

#### Archived Examples Include:
- `echo-client/` - Example gRPC client implementation
- `echo-server/` - Example gRPC server implementation  
- `config-patterns/` - Configuration pattern examples
- `config-validation/` - Configuration validation examples
- `interceptors/` - Interceptor usage examples
- `transport-agnostic/` - Transport-agnostic implementation examples
- `proto/` - Protocol buffer definitions and generated code

## Future Plans

These examples will be extracted into a separate repository when version 0.1 is released, allowing them to evolve independently from the core library.

## Usage

If you need to reference these examples during development, they are still available in this archive directory, but they are not maintained as part of the main project's build system.
