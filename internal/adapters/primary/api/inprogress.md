in enhanced security scan 
The job failed due to an error installing `govulncheck`:

```
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.2.0
go: golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.2.0: invalid version: unknown revision cmd/govulncheck/v1.2.0
```

**Root cause:**  
There is no `v1.2.0` tag or release for `golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck`. The latest available version (as of August 2025) is likely `v1.1.0`.

**Solution:**  
Update your workflow or script to use a valid version for `govulncheck`. For example, change:

```sh
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.2.0
```
to:
```sh
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.1.0
```

**Steps to fix:**
1. Open your workflow definition at [.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/sufield/ephemos/blob/24654e5ccd16c1b1504bfe686a4942d2d661848a/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
2. Locate the step or script that installs `govulncheck`.
3. Change the version to `v1.1.0` or remove the version suffix to get the latest:
   ```sh
   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
   ```
4. Commit and push the update.
5. Re-run the workflow.

**Summary:**  
Update the version of `govulncheck` to a valid release. This will resolve the job failure due to the invalid package version.

In enhanced dependency check ci job, fix this issue The job failed because the command to install govulncheck was incorrect:

```
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.2.0
```

Error:
```
invalid version: unknown revision cmd/govulncheck/v1.2.0
```

**Solution:**
Use the correct installation method for govulncheck. The officially supported way (as of Go 1.21+) is:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
```

Or specify a valid version if you need a specific one (use the main repo version, not a subdirectory version):

```bash
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.0.0
```

**Steps to Fix:**
1. Edit your workflow or script where govulncheck is installed.
2. Replace the failing line with:
   ```bash
   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
   ```

**Reference:**  
See the official documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck

**Next Steps:**  
Commit this change to your workflow or installation script and re-run the job.

benchmarks ci job, fix required for this issue: 

The job failed at two key steps:

1. **Protobuf/Go Code Generation Step**
   ```
   protoc --go_out=examples/proto --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
       --go-grpc_out=examples/proto --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
       -I examples/proto examples/proto/echo.proto
   ```
   The logs show that this step failed, and the subsequent checks for `echo.pb.go` and `echo_grpc.pb.go` also failed, indicating that these files were not generated.

2. **Benchmark Step**
   While benchmarks ran and passed, the overall job still exited with code 1 due to the earlier failure.

---

## Solution

### 1. Ensure protoc plugins are installed
The most common cause for missing `.pb.go` files is that the required plugins for Go code generation are not installed or not in your `PATH`.

Add the following to your job setup before running `protoc`:

```bash
# Install protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

# Make sure GOPATH/bin is in your PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

### 2. Verify your `protoc` command and input files
Double check that `examples/proto/echo.proto` exists and is valid.

### 3. Example Workflow Fix
In your workflow definition (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on ref `24654e5ccd16c1b1504bfe686a4942d2d661848a`), before the protobuf generation step, add:

```yaml
- name: Install protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc
  run: |
    go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
    go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
    export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Then run your `protoc` command as before.

---

### 4. Commit and Push

After making these changes, commit and push to your branch. Your job should now succeed at the code generation step, and the missing Go files should be generated.
