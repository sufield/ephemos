# Security Features in Ephemos

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Ephemos project to ensure a secure development and runtime environment.

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Automated scanning** on every push and pull request
- **Weekly scheduled scans** for continuous monitoring
- **Security-extended queries** for comprehensive vulnerability detection
- **Custom configuration** tailored for Go projects
- **Integration with GitHub Security Dashboard** for centralized vulnerability management

### Local Security Scanning
Run comprehensive security checks locally before committing:

```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

This script checks for:
- Hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Known security vulnerabilities in Go code
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Insecure coding patterns
- File permission issues

## Dependency Security

### Vulnerability Monitoring
- **Dependabot alerts** for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **govulncheck** integration for Go-specific vulnerability detection
- **Regular dependency updates** through automated PRs

### Best Practices
- Pin dependency versions in `go.mod`
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Use of minimal, well-maintained dependencies

## Runtime Security

### SPIFFE/SPIRE Integration
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** authentication between services
- **Identity attestation** using SPIFFE workload API
- **Automatic certificate rotation** for enhanced security
- **Zero-trust network model** implementation

### Secure Configuration
- **Environment-based secrets** management
- **Secure defaults** in all configuration options
- **Configuration validation** to prevent misconfigurations
- **Least privilege** access patterns

## Code Security Standards

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Input validation** on all external data
- **Proper error handling** without information leakage
- **Secure random number generation** using crypto/rand
- **Memory-safe operations** following Go best practices

### Prohibited Patterns
The following patterns are flagged by our security scans:
- Use of weak cryptographic functions (MD5, SHA1)
- HTTP connections without TLS
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Command injection risks
- Insecure TLS configurations

## Development Security

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Secret scanning to prevent credential commits
- Linting for security-related code issues
- Dependency vulnerability checks

### Security Reviews
- Mandatory security review for security-sensitive changes
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security-focused code reviews

## Incident Response

### Vulnerability Disclosure
- Responsible disclosure process documented in SECURITY.md
- Private security advisories for sensitive issues
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure timeline

### Response Process
1. **Immediate assessment** of reported vulnerabilities
2. **Impact analysis** and severity classification
3. **Fix development** and testing
4. **Coordinated disclosure** and patch release
5. **Post-incident review** and process improvement

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Metrics
- CodeQL scan results and trends
- Dependency vulnerability counts
- Security issue resolution times
- False positive rates and accuracy

### Audit Logging
- Security-relevant events logging
- Authentication and authorization events
- Configuration changes tracking
- Access pattern monitoring

## Tools and Integrations

### GitHub Security Features
- **Code scanning** with CodeQL
- **Secret scanning** for credential detection
- **Dependency scanning** with Dependabot
- **Security advisories** for vulnerability tracking

### Third-party Tools
- **gosec**: Go security analyzer
- **gitleaks**: Secret detection
- **nancy**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **govulncheck**: Go vulnerability database checks

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10** vulnerability prevention
- **CIS Controls** implementation where applicable
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** alignment

### OpenSSF Scorecard
This project maintains a high OpenSSF Scorecard score through:
- Comprehensive SAST implementation
- Dependency update automation
- Vulnerability disclosure process
- Signed releases and commits
- Active maintenance practices

## Getting Started with Security

### For Developers
1. Install security tools: `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest`
2. Run local security scan: `./scripts/security-scan.sh`
3. Review security guidelines in SECURITY.md
4. Enable pre-commit hooks for automated checks

### For Security Teams
1. Monitor GitHub Security Dashboard
2. Review CodeQL scan results regularly
3. Assess Dependabot alerts promptly
4. Conduct periodic security audits
