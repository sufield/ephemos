If your tool uses the `go-spiffe` SDK to interact with the SPIRE Server and Agent (e.g., to fetch SVIDs or manage registrations), it must register itself as a workload with the SPIRE Server to obtain a SPIFFE ID and SVID. This is necessary for secure communication with the SPIRE infrastructure and for services using your tool to register and identify with other services. Below, I explain why and provide actionable guidance, keeping the response concise and within 1000 characters.

### Why Registration is Needed
- **SPIFFE/SPIRE Security Model**: The SPIRE Agent authenticates workloads via attestation, using selectors (e.g., `unix:uid:<id>`). Your tool, as a workload, needs a registration entry in the SPIRE Server to map its selectors to a SPIFFE ID.
- **SVID Issuance**: The `go-spiffe` SDK’s `workloadapi.NewX509Source` requires an SVID, which the SPIRE Agent issues only to registered workloads.
- **Trust**: Registering your tool ensures it’s trusted within the SPIFFE trust domain, enabling secure interactions with other services.

### Actionable Guidance
1. **Register Tool as a Workload**:
   - Create a registration entry for your tool:
     ```bash
     spire-server entry create \
       -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/ephemos-tool \
       -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
       -selector unix:uid:$(id -u) \
       -admin true  # If tool manages registrations
     ```
2. **Configure SDK**:
   - Use `go-spiffe/v2` to fetch the tool’s SVID:
     ```go
     import "github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe/v2/workloadapi"
     source, err := workloadapi.NewX509Source(ctx)
     ```
3. **Set `EPHEMOS_CONFIG`**:
   - Point to a config file (e.g., `ephemos.yaml`) with the SPIRE socket path.
4. **Verify Attestation**: Ensure the tool runs with selectors matching the registration entry.
5. **Document**: Add setup instructions in `README.md` for registering the tool.

### Notes
- If your tool only facilitates client/server registration (e.g., via CLI), it needs a SPIFFE ID with `admin` privileges to manage entries.
- Without registration, the SPIRE Agent will reject SVID requests, breaking authentication.

This ensures your tool integrates securely with SPIRE using `go-spiffe`.

## Why register using CLI?

Yes, the CLI command to register your tool as a workload with the SPIRE Server is typically run once by an admin during setup, and it does not need to be done programmatically through code. The `go-spiffe` SDK can then use the registered SPIFFE ID to fetch SVIDs without embedding registration logic. Below, I provide concise guidance on this approach, ensuring alignment with SPIFFE/SPIRE best practices and keeping the response within 1000 characters.

### Why CLI Registration is Sufficient
- **One-Time Setup**: The `spire-server entry create` command registers the tool’s SPIFFE ID and selectors (e.g., `unix:uid:<id>`), persisting in the SPIRE Server’s database.
- **No Code Needed**: The `go-spiffe` SDK’s `workloadapi.NewX509Source` fetches SVIDs for the registered tool without requiring programmatic registration.
- **Admin Control**: Manual CLI registration ensures admins control trust policies securely.

### Actionable Guidance
1. **Run CLI Registration**:
   - Execute during setup:
     ```bash
     spire-server entry create \
       -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/ephemos-tool \
       -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
       -selector unix:uid:$(id -u) \
       -admin true  # If tool manages registrations
     ```
2. **Configure Tool**:
   - In `cmd/ephemos-cli/main.go`, use `go-spiffe` to fetch SVID:
     ```go
     import "github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe/v2/workloadapi"
     source, err := workloadapi.NewX509Source(ctx, workloadapi.WithAddr("unix:///tmp/spire-agent.sock"))
     ```
3. **Set Config**:
   - Use `config/ephemos.yaml` to specify the SPIRE socket path.
4. **Document in `README.md`**:
   - Add instructions for admins to run the `spire-server entry create` command.
5. **Verify**: Run `spire-server entry show` to confirm registration.

### Notes
- Ensure the tool runs with the same selectors (e.g., UID) as registered.
- The `admin` flag is needed if the tool manages other registrations.

This approach keeps registration separate from code, aligning with SPIFFE/SPIRE best practices.
